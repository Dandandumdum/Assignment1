# Assignment1
Assignment 1 for Noroff and Experis Academy

This project is provides a program that can create characters for an RPG and assign specific attributes to them,
based upon four different class types (Mage, Warrior, Rogue, and Ranger). In addition to this weapons and armor can be
to futher alter the player characters attributes. Functionality exists that prevents certain class types from using 
certain weapon and armor types e.g Warrior class characters may not equip Wand type weapons, or Cloth type armor.

Test functionality is within the tests directory and contains both CharacterTest and ItemTest.
Within each of these files are tests replicating the desired requirements of the system as outlined in the specification.
All tests are designed to assess a "true" output.
